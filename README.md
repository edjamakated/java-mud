# java-mud
A simple MUD (multi user dungeon) game in Java

just outlining the game for now

have always wanted to create a 2d game in Java

Here are some popular Java libraries for networking, database, and graphics:

1. Networking:
   - Java's built-in `java.net` package: It provides support for socket programming and other network-related tasks.
   - Netty: A high-performance, non-blocking I/O library for building network applications.
   - Kryonet: A simple and efficient library for implementing TCP and UDP connections, especially useful for games.

2. Database:
   - JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): A standard Java API for connecting to databases. You'll need to use a JDBC driver specific to your database (e.g., MySQL Connector/J for MySQL, PostgreSQL JDBC Driver for PostgreSQL, etc.).
   - JPA (Java Persistence API) with Hibernate: A more abstract, high-level API for working with databases using object-relational mapping (ORM) concepts.
   - Spring Data: Provides a consistent programming model for data access, supporting various databases and APIs like JPA, MongoDB, Redis, and more.

3. Graphics:
   - Java's built-in `java.awt` and `javax.swing` packages: These provide basic graphics capabilities and GUI components for desktop applications.
   - JavaFX: A more modern and powerful alternative to AWT/Swing for creating rich, desktop applications with improved graphics capabilities.
   - LibGDX: A popular game development framework that supports 2D and 3D graphics rendering, as well as audio, input, and other game-related features.

Other libraries to consider:
- Gson or Jackson: For handling JSON serialization/deserialization when communicating between client and server or when storing data.
- SLF4J with Logback or Log4j: For logging purposes in your application.

As for additional classes or methods, it depends on your game's specific requirements. Some possibilities include:
- A `CollisionDetector` class to handle collision detection between characters, NPCs, and items.
- A `GameEvent` class to represent events like player actions or NPC interactions.
- A `GameState` class to manage the overall state of the game, including win/loss conditions or player progress.
- A `Chat` class to handle in-game chat functionality between players.
- Additional methods in the `Client` and `Server` classes to handle events like player disconnects, game pauses, or other network-related issues.

Remember that as you develop your game, you may need to refine the structure and add more classes or methods based on your specific needs.
